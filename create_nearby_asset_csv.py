# per Chris - drains to assets (inlets, sed MHs, etc) can cross boundaries so can't exclude (create domains) strictly based on boundaries
# may be able to exclude based on distance - says 200 - 250' should do it - therefore need to modify original pseudo
# buffer hydrant, intersect buffer with "drains to" assets to create asset_dict

# intent is for result of this to be used as a standalone csv input for a Survey123 domain
# known problem with the result is you may get outlier drains to assets that are within threshold for multiple hydrants or outside of the threshold
# or drains to assets that are just missing because of laggy or bad dataâ˜»
# the ideal would be to perhaps use Arcade to apply this threshold for selected hydrant individually


# DROPPING THIS IN FAVOR OF HAVING RAD QC THE INPUT SO AS NOT TO BE TOO RESTRICTIVE ON INPUT (TOO MANY OUTLIERS) - 20240522
